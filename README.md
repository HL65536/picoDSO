# picoDSO
================

**Open-Source Oscilloscope based on the Raspberry Pi Pico**

## Project Status
---------------

The minimum viable product is ready, and development of new features is 
ongoing. Updates will be published regularly, although the pace may be 
slow.

## Key Features
--------------

* **Flexible Data Acquisition**: Use either the internal ADC(s) of the 
Raspberry Pi Pico to measure up to ~2MSa/s or 1-2 faster external ADCs 
(requires a custom PCB) for >50MSa/s at 8 bit.
* **Optional PCB**: The project can be built on a breadboard or with an 
optional PCB for easier assembly and improved performance.
* **Display Options**: Supports both SSD1306 and ST7789 displays, with 
potential support for more in the future.
